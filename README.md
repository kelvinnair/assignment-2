Data Mining Assignment Phase 2
Q1)
The domain of this project is a bakery chain that consists about 40 different pastry items and 10 diferent drinks.
There are 50 items in total with their product ID ranging from 0 to 49 in the dataset "1000i.csv" (Extended Bakery
Dataset with 1000 receipts). The potential benefits that could be derived from association rule mining is that it could
help to analyze the data and predict the customer behavior on buying the items. In association rule, it uses if/then pattern
and uses 2 type of criterias which are "support" and "confidence". Support indicates of how ferequent the items appear in the
database, while confidence is the indication of the number of times the if/then statements found to be true.
So what would improve the use of the patterns? We can predict the customer's likeliness of buying some specific items with the "confidence" criteria applied.

With the asoociation rules discovered, the client can improve their store layout to increase the sales of least item bought in their
store. Besides that, the client can do such promotion based on the association rules results. Not only that, they can also update their
product catalog to boost up their sales.
